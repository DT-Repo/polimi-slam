In the directory progetto_ROS there are the subscriber and publisher node src/sub_car.ccp, the custom mesage msg/dtOdom.msg and dynamic_reconfigure file cfg/parameters.cfg.

To change source of Odometry you can execute "rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure"
and then select odomtype Differential_Drive (choice 0) or Ackermann(choice 1).
Instead to change init values of position you can select init_value_x and init_value_y in a range of (0,0) - (100,100);

The structure of tf tree is composed by (odom_DDK)-->(car) for Differential Drive Model
instead for Ackerman model (odom_ACK)-->(car). The Broadcaster is the same that is /sub_car.   (World-Fixed) ---> (Robot-Fixed)

The custom message used for the odometry is dtOdom and it's a copy of nav_msgs/Odometry in fact it's composed by a std_msgs/Header, string child_frame_id, geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance and geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovariance.

First of all play the bag publishing speedL_stamped, speedR_stamped and steer_stamped.
To start the node sub_car.cpp run ' rosrun progetto_ROS sub_car  ' (ater to have run catkin_make and roscore ).
You will see on the terminal extracted values from the bag.
Launch the dynamc reconfigure tool ' rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure '
to switch between Differential Drive and Ackerman Odometries or to reset initial position (init_value_x, init_value_y) to a (0,0)-(100,100).
(Only the odometry selected will publish values).
To see published values select an Odometry and run 'rostopic echo /OdometryDDK ' or 
' rostopic echo /OdometryACK '.
To see tf tree, instead, run ' rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree  ' .
To see vector transformations run 'rviz' and add TF and select odom_DDK (or odom_ACK) as Fixed Frame.
